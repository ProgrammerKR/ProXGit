Bash and Zsh completion
=======================

From within the proxgit root run:

```bash
source contrib/autocompletion/bash_autocomplete
```

or for zsh run:

```bash
source contrib/autocompletion/zsh_autocomplete
```

These scripts will check if proxgit is on the path and if so add autocompletion for `proxgit`. Or if not autocompletion will work for `./proxgit`.
If proxgit has been installed as a different program pass in the `PROG` environment variable to set the correct program name.
